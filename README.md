# producing-web-service

With this Spring Guide, I tried to create a SOAP based web service server that can produce data about several European country. Unfortunately, it had many of the same problems as the last SOAP Spring Guide, where the JAXB had trouble producing the Java classes from the WSDL. So I abandonded it because it is likely a problem on the Spring Guide's end.
